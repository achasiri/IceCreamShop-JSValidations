# IceCreamShopUIProject

This project creates a sample UI page with dropdown, radio button and checkbox. When a
user selects particular icecream features the cost will be calculated and displayed based on fixed rates.
Using random function a random number is generated for order delivery time and displayed on screem.
Along with these some basic validations are added like the orer button should only be activated when all the required fields are
selected otherwise disabled. An according image has to be displayed when customer chooses icecreame flavor value below the screen.
